## Overview Web Development Roadmaps

![](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/img_frontend.jpg)

### **Step 1** Learn Basic

Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Responsive Web Design is used in all types of modern web development.

ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 5) is supported in all modern browsers. Take a good look at it, especially the new array functions.

- HTML
  - [What is HTML ???](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp) - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, elements are represented by <> tags
- CSS

  - [What is CSS ???](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_css.asp) - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

- JavaScripts
  - [What is JavaScript ???](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_js.asp) - JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web

### **Step 2** Dig Deeper

When you feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, it is time to dig deeper.

You should learn how to use Maps, Fonts and Icons in HTML.

On the JavaScript side, you should learn how to access the HTML DOM.

You should also learn how to use AJAX and JSON for making server requests.

- HTML
  - [What is the HTML DOM?](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp) - he HTML DOM is an Object Model for HTML, an API (Programming Interface) for JavaScript
- CSS
  - [CSS Animation ???](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!
  - [What is Responsive Web Design ???](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_responsive.asp) - Responsive Web Design is about making a website look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)
- JavaScript
  - [What is JSON ???](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, lightweight format for storing and transporting data

### **Step 3** Choose Frameworks

Now it is time to look at some Frameworks.

On the CSS side you should choose a framework for responsive web design:
Bootstrap / Material Design / W3.CSS

On the JavaScript side you should learn at least one modern framework:
React.js / Angular.js / Vue.js / W3.JS / Svelt

Maybe the popularity of jQuery has passed the top, but it is still the most used JavaScript framework.

- CSS
  - [What is SASS ???](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
- JavaScript
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/) - These docs assume that you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards, such as classes and modules.
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes
  - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only
  - [Augular vs React vs Vue ](https://hackernoon.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-which-is-the-best-choice-for-2019-16ce0deb3847) - Which is the Best Choice for 2019?
  - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces

### **Step 4** Going a bit further

There are also various tools and concepts that you can go and study such as testing and bundling for production.

- Module Bundle
   - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Javascript module bundler for usage in a browser
   - [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Zero configuration web application bundler
- Automatic Testing
   - [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) - Node library with high level-API for crawling SPA, automate testing
   - [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) - Frontend testing tool, performs end to end testing across various browsers & platform.
- [Microfrontend](https://micro-frontends.org/) - Microservice idea to frontend development
